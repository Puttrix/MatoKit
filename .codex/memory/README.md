# Codex Memory Directory

This directory captures durable knowledge for the project. Use the files as follows:

- `conversations.md`: Summaries of conversations worth remembering. Log insights, agreements, and outstanding questions.
- `decisions.md`: Record architectural or process decisions with enough context to justify them later.
- `working-notes.md`: Lightweight scratchpad for active work; prune or promote items when they solidify.

When adding entries:
1. Prefer newest-first ordering.
2. Capture dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).
3. Keep entries concise; link to code or docs when relevant.

Update these logs as part of regular Codex sessions so future collaborators have shared context.
