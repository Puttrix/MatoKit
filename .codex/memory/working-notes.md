# Codex Working Notes

Scratchpad for ongoing investigations, design ideas, or partial research. Clean up or promote items to the decision or conversation logs when finalized.

## Active Threads
- Reassess adopting @optimizely-opal/opal-tools-sdk periodically once Opal integration blockers are clearer.
- Update root `README.md` whenever tasks or milestones are completed (process guardrail).

## Parking Lot
- Use this section for future work that is not yet prioritized.

## Archive
- Move resolved items here for historical reference.
